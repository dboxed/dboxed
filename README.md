# About DBoxed

Welcome to the home of Dboxed development ðŸ‘‹

Dboxed is a platform to manage and run your workloads on any servers you like. This includes cloud based servers
(e.g. Hetzner or AWS) or bare-metal servers (e.g. in your home, office or datacenter).

Dboxed is fully Open Source and will stay this way. You will always be able to self-host it with all its features.

At the same time, you can use [Dboxed Cloud](https://dboxed.io/docs/dboxed-cloud). If you do this, you can still bring
your own servers or use integrated cloud/machine providers (e.g. Hetzner or AWS, and more in the future).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started, read the docs at https://dboxed.io, especially the quick-start guides
([CLI](https://dboxed.io/docs/get-started/quick-start-cli) and [Web UI](https://dboxed.io/docs/get-started/quick-start-web)).
